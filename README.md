# kong-plugin-cookies-to-headers
A Kong plugin that will add Authorization header from cookie.

## How it works

When enabled, this plugin will add new headers to requests based on set cookie. For example, if the cookie value is set like this

```ini
name=value
oauthtoken=13ca678d2aa8454599678e792266ea96
```

then the following headers would be added

```http
Authorization   : Bearer 13ca678d2aa8454599678e792266ea96
```

## Install

Install luarocks and run the following command

```bash
luarocks install kong-plugin-cookies-to-headers
```

## Configuration

```bash

--data "name=cookies-to-headers" \
